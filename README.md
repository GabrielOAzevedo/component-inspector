# React Component Inspector

This is the official repository of the best component inspector that I know of, and I know a total of one. Please feel free to clone, create new functionality, use it as your own or do whatever you want to do with this.
This is a work in progress project (WIP) and I will try my best to save it from github limbo, a place where all personal projects eventually end.

## Installation

Just clone, npm install, npm run dev and use, no dependencies needed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabrielOAzevedo/component-inspector.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Just edit the files if you want, save, test your code, do whatever you feel like.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

(Your time would be better used elsewhere though)

## License
There is no license for the code, you can do whatever you want, even brag about how cool you are right :sunglasses:?
